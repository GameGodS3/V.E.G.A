## Intro
  ***V.E.G.A. (acronym for Versatile Embedded Guidance Assistant)*** is an ambitious project for making an open-source personal assistant which can be embedded into multiple computer systems (in the super-far away future). And by computer systems, we do not limit ourselves to just PCs, Laptops and Phones; but Car systems, Smart TVs, and other IoT.
  Currently (i.e. at the time of the editing of this readme file), VEGA is only an innocent, harmless python script which will only run very basic tasks in Windows. Do note that you'll need python to run this script (I assume that people who opened this up are brainy enough to figure that out already).
  
## Future plans
- [ ]Expand the command library
- [ ]Enable voice input
- [ ]Probably (not very necessarily) include AI
- [ ]Make a GUI
- [x]Wrote this so that you assume it is marked as complete xD

Thank you for reading this lazy piece of text.
