## Intro
  ***V.E.G.A. (acronym for Versatile Embedded Guidance Assistant)*** is an ambitious project for making an open-source personal assistant which can be embedded into multiple computer systems (in the super-far away future). And by computer systems, we do not limit ourselves to just PCs, Laptops and Phones; but Car systems, Smart TVs, and other IoT.
  
  Currently (i.e. at the time of the editing of this readme file), VEGA is only an innocent, harmless python script which will only run very basic tasks in Windows. Do note that you'll need python to run this script (I assume that people who opened this up are brainy enough to figure that out already).

## Future plans
- [ ] Expand the command library
- [ ] Enable voice input
- [ ] Probably (not very necessarily) include AI
- [ ] Make a GUI
- [x] Wrote this so that you assume it is complete xD


## Installation (and latest update)
 Run the install.py script before using V.E.G.A. This is for the automated web login feature.
 
 As of now, only Instagram has been added for automated log in. For logging in to your Instagram, tell V.E.G.A. to "log in to instagram". (Asks for your credentials in the first login. Don't panic. Credentials are stored locally in your machine as a CSV file. It aint getting sent anywhere. I am not Zuckerberg.
 

Thank you for reading this lazy piece of text.
